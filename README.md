#### Data Scientist | Data Analyst | ML Engineer

#### Who am I?
` I'm a data wizard with 4 plus years of experience in the land of numbers and statistics. My secret power is using data to solve real-world problems and make sense of all that chaos out there.

I'm a big fan of all things data, from crunching numbers to building fancy dashboards that show off my skills. I'm pretty good at programming languages like Python  , and I'm a pro at manipulating data using SQL and other tools.

But my greatest joy comes from turning raw data into actionable insights that help businesses grow and thrive. Whether it's building predictive models or creating data visualizations, I'm always looking for ways to help businesses make smarter decisions.

When I'm not playing with data, you can find me collaborating with other teams, like product managers and software engineers. I believe that teamwork makes the dream work, and I love being part of a team that's working towards a common goal.

So if you're looking for a data professional who knows how to have fun while getting stuff done, then look no further! I'm your guy, and I'm ready to help you take your data game to the next level. `
